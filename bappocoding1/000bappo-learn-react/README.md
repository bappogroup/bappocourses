## Learning React for Bappo

Below you find a list of resources that should help you gain enough knowledge about Javascript, React and React-Native for the purpose of coding in the Bappo platform.
We suggest that you start at the top and work your way down, or simply use it as a reference if you prefer.

## Javascript knowledge
Before learning react you should know Javascript well. You need 3+ months experience in Javascript, or alternatively 500+ hours over a longer period. 

> One good way to test if your knowdlege is up to date is to check out [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) concise summary of Javascript. If you find anything in there that you are not 100% familiar with, then take some time to zoom into the topic and master it.

So what if you don't know Javascript well yet.
There are plenty of Javascript courses online. We recommend The Basic Javascript and ES6 courses on the [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) website.  You'll find these two courses under the heading of "Javascript Algorythms and Data Structures"

If you dont have time for the whole course, at least watch #4 about Classes, #5 about Class constructors, and lesson #8 about Inheritance

If you can work your way through the above resources that will put you in a great starting position for React.
